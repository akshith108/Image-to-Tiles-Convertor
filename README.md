# image-to-tiles-convertor
If you want to use it, download the .exe file and run it, and tell it by how many rows and columns you want to divide the image, and tell it where to open and save the image. It will save the image with name tile_{i}{j} where i and j are numbers, in the directory where you told to save. That's it so simple to use.
